# If a job ID is specified, this examples add operations to that job. Otherwise,

#
# Your application should create a single job containing all of the operations
# for a user list. This will be far more efficient than creating and running

# * For privacy purposes, the user list size will show as zero until the list has
# at least 100 users. After that, the size will be rounded to the two most

=head1 NAME

add_customer_match_user_list

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example uses Customer Match to create a new user list (a.k.a. audience) and
adds users to it.

This feature is only available to allowlisted accounts.
See https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717 for more details.

Note: It may take up to several hours for the list to be populated with users.
Email addresses must be associated with a Google account. For privacy purposes,
the user list size will show as zero until the list has at least 100 users.
After that, the size will be rounded to the two most significant digits.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

add_customer_match_user_list.pl [options]

    -help                       Show the help message.
    -customer_id                The Google Ads customer ID.
    -run_job			[optional] Run the OfflineUserDataJob after adding operations. Otherwise, only adds operations to the job.
