add_customer_match_user_list

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example uses Customer Match to create a new user list (a.k.a. audience) and
adds users to it.

Note: It may take up to several hours for the list to be populated with users.
Email addresses must be associated with a Google account. For privacy purposes,
the user list size will show as zero until the list has at least 1,000 users.
After that, the size will be rounded to the two most significant digits.
