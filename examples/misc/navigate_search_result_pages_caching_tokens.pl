=head1 DESCRIPTION

GoogleAdsService.Search results are paginated but they can only be retrieved in
sequence starting by the first page. More details at
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/paging.

This example searches campaigns illustrating how GoogleAdsService.Search result
page tokens can be cached and reused to retrieve previous pages. This is useful
when you need to request pages that were already requested in the past without
starting over from the first page. For example, it can be used to implement an
interactive application that displays a page of results at a time without caching
all the results first.

To add campaigns, run add_campaigns.pl.

    -help                       Show the help message.
    -customer_id                The Google Ads customer ID.
