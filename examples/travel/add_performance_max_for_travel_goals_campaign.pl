# This example shows how to create a Performance Max for travel goals campaign. It also uses
# TravelAssetSuggestionService to fetch suggested assets for creating an asset group. In case
# there are not enough assets for the asset group (required by Performance Max), this example will
# create more assets to fulfill the requirements.
#
# For more information about Performance Max campaigns, see
# https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/performance-max/overview.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - You must have at least one conversion action in the account. For more about conversion actions,
# see https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/overview#conversion_actions.
#
# Notes:
# - This example uses the default customer conversion goals. For an example of setting
#   campaign-specific conversion goals, see shopping_ads/add_performance_max_retail_campaign.pl.
# - To learn how to create asset group signals, see
#   advanced_operations/add_performance_max_campaign.pl.

=head1 NAME

add_performance_max_for_travel_goals_campaign

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This example shows how to create a Performance Max for travel goals campaign. It also uses
TravelAssetSuggestionService to fetch suggested assets for creating an asset group. In case
there are not enough assets for the asset group (required by Performance Max), this example will
create more assets to fulfill the requirements.

For more information about Performance Max campaigns, see
https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/performance-max/overview.

Prerequisites:
- You must have at least one conversion action in the account. For more about conversion actions,
see https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/overview#conversion_actions.

Notes:
- This example uses the default customer conversion goals. For an example of setting
  campaign-specific conversion goals, see shopping_ads/add_performance_max_retail_campaign.pl.
- To learn how to create asset group signals, see
  advanced_operations/add_performance_max_campaign.pl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

add_performance_max_for_travel_goals_campaign.pl [options]

    -help                         Show the help message.
    -customer_id                  The Google Ads customer ID.
    -place_id 					  The place ID of a hotel property. A place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database. See https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/place-id to learn more.
