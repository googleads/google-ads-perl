# This example shows how to retrieve recommendations and apply them in a batch.
#
# Recommendations should be applied shortly after they're retrieved. Depending
# on the recommendation type, a recommendation can become obsolete quickly, and
# obsolete recommendations throw an error when applied. For more details, see:
# https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/recommendations#take_action
#
# As of Google Ads API v15 users can subscribe to certain recommendation types
# to apply them automatically. For more details, see:
# https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/recommendations#auto-apply
#
# As of Google Ads API v16 users can proactively generate certain recommendation
# types during the campaign construction process. For more details see:

=head1 NAME

detect_and_apply_recommendations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The auto-apply feature, which automatically applies recommendations as they become eligible,
is currently supported by the Google Ads UI but not by the Google Ads API. See
https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10279006 for more information on using auto-apply
in the Google Ads UI.

This example demonstrates how an alternative can be implemented with the features that are
currently supported by the Google Ads API. It periodically retrieves and applies `KEYWORD`
recommendations with default parameters.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

detect_and_apply_recommendations.pl [options]

    -help                       Show the help message.
    -customer_id                The Google Ads customer ID.
