=head1 NAME

get_account_hierarchy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gets the account hierarchy of the specified manager customer ID and login customer
ID. If you don't specify them, the example will instead print the hierarchies
of all accessible customer accounts for your authenticated Google account.

Note that if the list of accessible customers for your authenticated Google
account includes accounts within the same hierarchy, this example will retrieve
and print the overlapping portions of the hierarchy for each accessible customer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_account_hierarchy.pl [options]

    -help                       Show the help message.
    -manager_customer_id        [optional] The Google Ads manager customer ID.
    -login_customer_id          [optional] The login customer ID.
