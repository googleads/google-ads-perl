=head1 NAME

Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchStreamHandler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $search_stream_request =
    Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService::SearchGoogleAdsStreamRequest
    ->new({
      customerId => $customer_id,
      query => "SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name FROM campaign ORDER BY campaign.id"
    });

  my $google_ads_service = $api_client->GoogleAdsService();

  my $search_stream_handler = Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchStreamHandler->new({
    service => $google_ads_service,
    request => $search_stream_request
  });

  $search_stream_handler->process_contents(
    sub {
      my $google_ads_row = shift;
      # Do something with each GooglerAdsRow object.
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The handler class to process the response of stream search. The handler should be
constructed with a L<Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService> and a
L<Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService::SearchGoogleAdsStreamRequest>.

  my $search_stream_handler = Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchStreamHandler->new({
    service => $google_ads_service,
    request => $search_stream_request
  });

=head1 METHODS

=head2 process_contents

Processes the response content of stream search.

=head3 Parameters

=over

=item *

I<for_each_callback>: The callback subroutine which is invoked to process each
parsed L<Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService::GoogleAdsRow>.
