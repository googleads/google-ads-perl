=head1 NAME

Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchGoogleAdsIterator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $search_request =
    Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService::SearchGoogleAdsRequest
    ->new({
      customerId => $customer_id,
      query => "SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name FROM campaign ORDER BY campaign.id",
      pageSize => 100
    });

  my $google_ads_service = $api_client->GoogleAdsService();

  my $iterator = Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchGoogleAdsIterator->new({
    service => $google_ads_service,
    request => $search_request
  });

  while ($iterator->has_next) {
    my $google_ads_row = $iterator->next;
    # Do something with each GooglerAdsRow object.
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The iterator class to access all rows that match the search query. The iterator
should be constructed with a L<Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService>
and a L<Google::Ads::GoogleAds::V11::Services::GoogleAdsService::SearchGoogleAdsRequest>.

  my $iterator = Google::Ads::GoogleAds::Utils::SearchGoogleAdsIterator->new({
    service => $google_ads_service,
    request => $search_request
  });

=head1 METHODS

=head2 has_next

Checks whether the iteration has more elements.

=head3 Returns

True, if the iteration has more elements. False, otherwise.

=head2 next

Returns the next element in the iteration.

=head3 Returns
